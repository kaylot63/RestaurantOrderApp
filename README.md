1. Overview

The Restaurant Order Web Application is a Django-based system designed to streamline the process of placing and managing orders in a restaurant setting. It provides a user-friendly interface for customers to view the menu, place orders, and receive notifications about their order status. Additionally, it offers a staff dashboard for chefs and waiters to manage incoming orders in real-time.
2. System Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture, with the following components:

    Client Side: The client side consists of web browsers running on customer devices, through which they interact with the application.

    Server Side: The server side is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework. It includes the following components:
        Views: Handle incoming requests, process data, and render templates.
        Models: Define the structure of the database and manage data.
        Templates: HTML templates to present the user interface.
        Static files: CSS, JavaScript, and image files for styling and functionality.
        URLs: Define the URL patterns and their corresponding views.

    Database: The application uses a relational database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to store menu items, orders, and other data.

3. Features

    Menu Display: Display menu items categorized by breakfast, lunch, drinks, desserts, etc.
    Order Placement: Allow customers to add items to their cart and place orders.
    Real-time Updates: Provide real-time updates to staff about incoming orders.
    Staff Dashboard: Allow staff members to view and manage orders.
    Confirmation Messages: Display confirmation messages to users upon successful actions (e.g., order placement).
    Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
